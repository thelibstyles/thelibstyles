# Hi there 👋,
## My name is Adam AKA thelibstyles. I am a 🤓 librarian, programmer ⌨️, digital creator 🎨 and cat dad 😻. 

### Things i am into at the moment:
* Vue 2, two way binding to create silly fun web forms
* CSS animation using custom vectors
* google fonts projects

Check out my projects on github and fork them like a nice piece of chocolate cake 🍰

If you are library programmer nerd like myself reach out and say hi! ,there might be a project we could co-lab on. ☕☕☕

Have an awesome day. 
See ya. 😀
